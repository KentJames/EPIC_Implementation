	title = {Automatically {Scheduling} {Halide} {Image} {Processing} {Pipelines}},
	abstract = {The Halide image processing language has proven to be an effec- tive system for authoring high-performance image processing code. Halide programmers need only provide a high-level strategy for map- ping an image processing pipeline to a parallel machine (a schedule), and the Halide compiler carries out the mechanical task of generating platform-specific code that implements the schedule. Unfortunately, designing high-performance schedules for complex image process- ing pipelines requires substantial knowledge of modern hardware architecture and code-optimization techniques. In this paper we provide an algorithm for automatically generating high-performance schedules for Halide programs. Our solution extends the function bounds analysis already present in the Halide compiler to automat- ically perform locality and parallelism-enhancing global program transformations typical of those employed by expert Halide develop- ers. The algorithm does not require costly (and often impractical) auto-tuning, and, in seconds, generates schedules for a broad set of image processing benchmarks that are performance-competitive with, and often better than, schedules manually authored by expert Halide developers on server and mobile CPUs, as well as GPUs.},

We find that the antenna-based delays and mean phase offsets are stable to a few percent on timescales of days. We also find that these quantities are robust to employing a point source vs. a CLEAN calibration model, to similar accuracy. The GC can be used to calibrate for about Â±30min around transit. The complex antenna-based bandpass solutions do show significant changes from a point source to a CLEAN model, indicating that the intrinsic structure of the GC must be included in the BP calibration process. The bandpass solutions converge with 2 iterations of imaging and self-calibration, to within a few degrees and a few percent in phase and amplitude, and the BP solutions repeat from day to day to a similar level. We apply calibration solutions from the GC to other times, including when Cen- taurus A is transiting, and a high latitude field. Known sources are recovered (eg. Cen A), and the sky structure reproduces from day to day consistently. We track the peak amplitude of the GC in images through transit to get an estimate of the primary beam response, at least along the cut that the GC follows (1.63o from zenith). We find a FWHM for the beam cut of 12.6o averaging over the full band, and 13.5o for the lower part of the band (channels {\textless} 400 or frequencies below 141MHz), and 11.0o for the upper part of the band.},

	abstract = {We present further results from sky calibration, comparing Galactic Cen- ter (GC) calibration, to independent calibration using two sources at 21hr (the âBernardi Sourcesâ, BS). Full calibration can be performed using the BS sources ( delays, mean phase, bandpass), resulting in reasonable images, although with lower signal to noise relative to the Galactic center. The delay solutions match well between GC and BS calibration. However, the bandpass solutions do not match. The latter result suggests that the bandpass solutions reflect some com- bination of the true antenna response as a function of frequency, coupled with calibration model limitations, and possibly other antenna-specific responses. We find that bandpass amplitude solutions are strongly influenced by the data on the shortest baselines, where the signal to noise is highest, ie. the bandpass amplitude solutions change substantially when the shortest baselines are left out of the calibration process. Interestingly, the phase solutions appear to be more robust to using different baselines in the calibration. We see evidence for a sinu- soidal pattern in both the bandpass solutions, and in some of the visibilities on certain short spacings, for the GC data. The wavelength is about 20MHz across the bandpass spectrum, corresponding to 15m of pathlength, if it was a stand- ing wave. We investigate whether this pattern could be a standing wave within the structure of the dish itself, or a resonance between antennas in a baseline, or again, missing structure in the calibration model. The characteristic scale of 15m is close to the round trip distance from the feed to the edge of the dish, or the near-edge of neighboring antennas, hence suggestive of a standing wave.},

	abstract = {Using new CASA tools, we investigate closure phase behavior on redundant triads using HERA19 data. We consider data from HERA19 on the Bernardi source field at 21:00, and a high latitude field at 22:00. We find that the redun- dancy of the closure spectra improves with simpler fields (eg. two bright sources in main beam), and with longer baselines. This behavior is as expected if the non-redundancy is due to differences in the primary beam responses, coupled with the fact that the correlated signal can be dominated by diffuse emission filling the primary beams on these short spacings. Considering a strictly East- West oriented triad, the dispersion in the closure phase for redundant triads is between 6o to 16o over most of the spectra. These rms values translate into non-redundancy between baselines typically between 1.5\% to 4\%, as a function of frequency. We show that triads with a cross polarized antenna can still show coherence in the closure phase spectra, but the spectral behavior is completely different relative to normal triads, and would easily be seen in diagnostics based on redundant closure spectra. We investigate closure amplitudes. The closure amplitudes can diverge due to the division involved in the calculation.},

The Galactic Center provides a bright source which, we show, can be approximated as a point source sufficiently well to initialise the self-calibration loop and derive initial delays and antenna gains. Subsequent iteration using a more complex sky model derived from the data itself then converges to a reasonable bandpass calibration. The final image from two 10-minute snapshots has a dynamic range of 200:1, and shows the structure of the Galactic plane in the inner â¼ 10â¦. We describe the processing chain including: generating the UVFITS files with observed visibilties, CASA data formatting and flagging, initial point source calibration, and subsequent imaging and bandpass calibration. We discuss briefly data quality. We include python/CASA scripts to perform the full analysis from FITS file to final image, plus a detailed description on how to install a few of the custom CASA python routines. We conclude on how the process could help with overall array calibration, and be extended to other local sidereal time ranges.},

	abstract = {Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is a commonly-used power-management technique where the clock frequency of a processor is decreased to allow a corresponding reduction in the supply voltage. This re- duces power consumption, which can lead to significant reduction in the energy required for a computation, par- ticularly for memory-bound workloads. However, recent developments in processor and mem- ory technology have resulted in the saturation of pro- cessor clock frequencies, larger static power consump- tion, smaller dynamic power range and better idle/sleep modes. Each of these developments limit the potential energy savings resulting from DVFS. We analyse this trend by examining the potential of DVFS across three platforms with recent generations of AMD processors. We find that while DVFS is effective on the older plat- forms, it actually increases energy usage on the most recent platform, even for highly memory-bound work- loads. 1},

	abstract = {Realizing the next generation of radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) requires both more efficient hardware and algorithms than today's technology provides. The recently introduced image-domain gridding (IDG) algorithm is a novel approach towards solving the most compute-intensive parts of creating sky images: gridding and degridding. It avoids the performance bottlenecks of traditional AW-projection gridding by applying instrumental and environmental corrections in the image domain instead of in the Fourier domain. In this paper, we present the first implementations of this new algorithm for CPUs and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). A thorough performance analysis, in which we apply a modified roofline analysis, shows that our parallelization approaches and optimizations lead to nearly optimal performance on these architectures. The analysis also indicates that, by leveraging dedicated hardware to evaluate trigonometric functions, GPUs are both much faster and more energy efficient than regular CPUs. This makes IDG on GPUs a candidate for meeting the computational and energy efficiency constraints of future telescopes.},

We present new results based on ray-tracing a 10 Gpc scale simulation at 2-3 Mpc scale resolution to create a full sky kSZ map. The simulation includes, self-consistently, the effects of reionization on scales corresponding to multipoles \$10{\textbackslash}lesssim{\textbackslash}ell{\textbackslash}lesssim\{5000\}\$. We separate the kSZ map into Doppler (\${\textbackslash}mathbf\{v\}\$), Ostriker-Vishniac (\${\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash}mathbf\{v\}\$), patchy (\$x{\textbackslash}mathbf\{v\}\$), and third-order (\$x{\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash}mathbf\{v\}\$) components, and compute explicitly all the auto and cross correlations (e.g., \${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}mathbf\{v\}{\textbackslash}mathbf\{v\}{\textbackslash}rangle\$, \${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash}mathbf\{v\}\{x\}{\textbackslash}mathbf\{v\}{\textbackslash}rangle\$, etc.) that contribute to the total power. We find a complex dependence on the duration of reionization at \${\textbackslash}ell{\textbackslash}sim\{300\}\$ and evidence for a non-negligible (10-30 per cent) contribution from connected four point ionization-velocity correlations, \${\textbackslash}langle\{x\}{\textbackslash}mathbf\{v\}x{\textbackslash}mathbf\{v\}{\textbackslash}rangle\_c\$, that are usually neglected in analytical models. We also investigate the Doppler-large scale structure (LSS) correlation, focusing on two different probes: (1) cross power spectra with linearly biased tracers of LSS and (2) cold spots from infall onto large, rare {\textbackslash}ion\{H\}\{2\} regions centered on peaks in the matter distribution at redshifts \$z{\textgreater}10\$. Finally, the reionization history can be reconstructed at 5-10\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance by correlating 21-cm maps with existing CMB temperature maps at \${\textbackslash}ell{\textbackslash}!{\textless}{\textbackslash}!500\$ --sophisticated velocity reconstruction methods can probe the distribution of electrons in the IGM by using combined CMB and LSS measurements well into the epoch of reionization.

	abstract = {We study the evolution of supernova (SN) remnants of the first stars, taking proper account of the radiative feedback of the progenitor stars on the surroundings. We carry out a series of one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with radiative cooling, starting from initial configurations that are drawn from the results of our earlier radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the first H II regions. We primarily consider explosion energies E SN = 10 51 -10 53 ergs, appropriate for various types of single Population III supernovae, and also explore cases with greater energy to model multiple explosions. In low-mass ( \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] lesssim 10 6 M â ) halos, the stellar radiation significantly reduces the ambient gas density prior to the SN explosion. The blast wave quickly propagates over the halo's virial radius, leading to complete evacuation of the gas even with an input energy of 10 50 ergs. We find that a large fraction of the remnant's thermal energy is lost in 10 5 -10 7 yr by line cooling, whereas for larger explosion energies, the remnant expands even more rapidly with decreasing interior density and cools predominantly via the inverse Compton process, adding the bulk of the energy to cosmic microwave background photons. In higher mass ( 10 7 M â ) halos, the gas density near the explosion site remains high ( \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] gtrsim 10 4 cm -3 ), and the SN shock is heavily confined; the thermal energy of the remnant is quickly radiated away by free-free emission, even if the total input energy exceeds the binding energy of halos by 2 orders of magnitude. We show that the efficiency of halo destruction is determined not only by the explosion energy but also by the gas density profile and thus is controlled by radiative feedback prior to the explosion. We compute the emissivity of the remnants in various energy ranges and examine their detectability by future observations. Several implications of our results for the formation of the first quasars and second-generation stars in the universe are also discussed.},

	abstract = {It is widely recognized that nucleosynthetic output of the first, Population III supernovae was a catalyst defining the character of subsequent stellar generations. Most of the work on the earliest enrichment was carried out assuming that the first stars were extremely massive and that the associated supernovae were unusually energetic, enough to completely unbind the baryons in the host cosmic minihalo and disperse the synthesized metals into the intergalactic medium. Recent work, however, suggests that the first stars may in fact have been somewhat less massive, with a characteristic mass scale of a few tens of solar masses. We present a cosmological simulation following the transport of the metals synthesized in a Population III supernova assuming that it had an energy of 1e51 ergs, compatible with standard Type II supernovae. A young supernova remnant is inserted in the first star's relic HII region in the free expansion phase and is followed for 40 Myr employing adaptive mesh refinement and Lagrangian tracer particle techniques. The supernova remnant remains partially trapped within the minihalo and the thin snowplow shell develops pronounced instability and fingering. Roughly half of the ejecta turn around and fall back toward the center of the halo, with 1\% of the ejecta reaching the center in 30 kyr and 10\% in 10 Myr. The average metallicity of the combined returning ejecta and the pristine filaments feeding into the halo center from the cosmic web is 0.001 - 0.01 Z\_sun, but the two remain unmixed until accreting onto the central hydrostatic core that is unresolved at the end of the simulation. We conclude that if Population III stars had less extreme masses, they promptly enriched the host minihalos with metals and triggered Population II star formation.},

These observations translate into constraints on the strength and scale magnetic fields must have during the early stages of galaxy formation in order to seed the galactic dynamo. We examine mechanisms for the generation of magnetic fields that operate prior during inflation and during subsequent phase transitions such as electroweak symmetry breaking and the quark-hadron phase transition. The implications of strong primordial magnetic fields for the reionization epoch as well as the first generation of stars is discussed in detail. The exotic, early-Universe mechanisms are contrasted with astrophysical processes that generate fields after recombination. For example, a Biermann-type battery can operate in a proto-galaxy during the early stages of structure formation. Moreover, magnetic fields in either an early generation of stars or active galactic nuclei can be dispersed into the intergalactic medium.},

	abstract = {A critical challenge in measuring the power spectrum of 21 cm emission from cosmic reionization is compensating for the frequency dependence of an interferometer's sampling pattern, which can cause smooth-spectrum foregrounds to appear unsmooth and degrade the separation between foregrounds and the target signal. In this paper, we present an approach to foreground removal that explicitly accounts for this frequency dependence. We apply the delay transformation introduced in Parsons \& Backer to each baseline of an interferometer to concentrate smooth-spectrum foregrounds within the bounds of the maximum geometric delays physically realizable on that baseline. By focusing on delay modes that correspond to image-domain regions beyond the horizon, we show that it is possible to avoid the bulk of smooth-spectrum foregrounds. We map the point-spread function of delay modes to k -space, showing that delay modes that are uncorrupted by foregrounds also represent samples of the three-dimensional power spectrum, and can be used to constrain cosmic reionization. Because it uses only spectral smoothness to differentiate foregrounds from the targeted 21 cm signature, this per-baseline analysis approach relies on spectrally and spatially smooth instrumental responses for foreground removal. For sufficient levels of instrumental smoothness relative to the brightness of interfering foregrounds, this technique substantially reduces the level of calibration previously thought necessary to detect 21 cm reionization. As a result, this approach places fewer constraints on antenna configuration within an array, and in particular, facilitates the adoption of configurations that are optimized for power-spectrum sensitivity. Under these assumptions, we demonstrate the potential for the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) to detect 21 cm reionization at an amplitude of 10 mK 2 near k 0.2 h Mpc â1 with 132 dipoles in 7 months of observing.},

In 1885, Weierstrass (being 70 years of age) proved a rather astounding theorem that on the interval [0, 1], any continuous function can be approximated inï¬nitely close by a polynomial function. His proof heavily relied on intricate analysis concepts and involved building up a sequence of polynomials from a convolution with a Gaussian heat kernel. The proof we display in this paper, is not of Weierstrass, but of Bernstein. In 1912, Sergei Bernstein introduced his Bernstein polynomials to prove this theorem and used an elegant probabilistic argument. His argument involved the use of Chebyshevâs Inequality which we will shall also prove in this paper. Our rendition of Bernsteinâs proof is taken from Kenneth Levasseurâs short paper in The American Mathematical Monthly [3].},

We present a complete theory of the noise in a synthesis image valid for a source of arbitrary strength. The analysis presented here gives a deeper understanding of coherence theory as applied to astronomical imaging. In the limit of faint sources, we recover the standard estimates of noise in a synthesis image. In the opposite limit of a strong source we show that the noise in the synthesis image is dominated by self-noise, or the noise generated by the source signal itself. We extend our theory to imaging by the use of closure phase or the bispectrum. Application of our theory to large, lownoise arrays like the VLA, the planned Indian GMRT, or VLBI show that a fair number of sources are bright enough that self-noise is an important source of noise. We present formal expressions of self-noise in synthesis maps and show that the distribution of self-noise is not uniform across the map. We suggest that some of the best VLBI maps, with noise approaching the thermal noise, may in fact be limited by self-noise. We also show that there is a bias in the standard definition of the bispectrum phasor and hence the closure phase as well. Fortunately, this bias is negligible. Finally, we resolve some of the conceptual difficulties associated with the hybrid mapping procedure and suggest contrary to the established procedure that all closure phases carry information and there are no âbasicâ closure phases. In particular, we suggest that at low signal levels, characteristic of infrared interferometers, it is best to fit the model to all the closure phases and fringe amplitudes.},

	abstract = {21 cm cosmology is a promising new probe of the evolution of visible matter in our universe, especially during the poorly-constrained Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization. However, in order to separate the 21 cm signal from bright astrophysical foregrounds, we need an exquisite understanding of our telescopes so as to avoid adding spectral structure to spectrally-smooth foregrounds. One powerful calibration method relies on repeated simultaneous measurements of the same interferometric baseline to solve for the sky signal and for instrumental parameters simultaneously. However, certain degrees of freedom are not constrained by asserting internal consistency between redundant measurements. In this paper, we review the origin of these degeneracies of redundant-baseline calibration and demonstrate how they can source unwanted spectral structure in our measurement and show how to eliminate that additional, artiï¬cial structure. We also generalize redundant calibration to dual-polarization instruments, derive the degeneracy structure, and explore the unique challenges to calibration and preserving spectral smoothness presented by a polarized measurement.},

We employ commissioning data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array to investigate closure quantities in this densely packed grid array of 14m antennas operating at 100 MHz to 200 MHz. We investigate techniques that utilize closure phase spectra for redundant triads to estimate departures from redundancy for redundant baseline visibilities. We ï¬nd a median absolute deviation from redundancy in closure phase across the observed frequency range of about 4.5â¦. This value translates into a nonredundancy per visibility phase of about 2.6â¦, using proto-type electronics. The median absolute deviations from redundancy decrease with longer baselines. We show that closure phase spectra can be used to identify ill-behaved antennas in the array, independent of calibration. We investigate the temporal behaviour of closure spectra. The Allan variance increases after a one minute stride time, due to passage of the sky through the primary beam of the transit telescope. However, the closure spectra repeat to well within the noise per measurement at corresponding local sidereal times (LST) from day to day. In future papers in this series we will develop the technique of using closure phase spectra in the search for the H 21 cm signal from cosmic reionization.},

	abstract = {We present the first full release of a survey of the 150 MHz radio sky, observed with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope between April 2010 and March 2012 as part of the TGSS project. Aimed at producing a reliable compact source survey, our automated data reduction pipeline efficiently processed more than 2000 hours of observations with minimal human interaction. Through application of innovative techniques such as image-based flagging, direction-dependent calibration of ionospheric phase errors, correcting for systematic offsets in antenna pointing, and improving the primary beam model, we created good quality images for over 95 percent of the 5336 pointings. Our data release covers 36,900 square degrees (or 3.6 pi steradians) of the sky between -53 deg and +90 deg DEC, which is 90 percent of the total sky. The majority of pointing images have a background RMS noise below 5 mJy/beam with an approximate resolution of 25" x 25" (or 25" x 25" / cos (DEC - 19 deg) for pointings south of 19 deg DEC). We have produced a catalog of 0.62 Million radio sources derived from an initial, high reliability source extraction at the 7 sigma level. For the bulk of the survey, the measured overall astrometric accuracy is better than 2" in RA and DEC, while the flux density accuracy is estimated at {\textasciitilde}10 percent. Within the scope of the TGSS ADR project, the source catalog as well as 5336 mosaic images (5 deg x 5 deg) and an image cutout service, are made publicly available online as a service to the astronomical community. Next to enabling a wide range of different scientific investigations, we anticipate that these survey products provide a solid reference for various new low-frequency radio aperture array telescopes (LOFAR, LWA, MWA, SKA-low), and can play an important role in characterizing the EoR foreground. The TGSS ADR project aims at continuously improving the quality of the survey data products.},

	abstract = {The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is a staged experiment to measure 21 cm emission from the primordial intergalactic medium (IGM) throughout cosmic reionization (z = 6 â 12), and to explore earlier epochs of our Cosmic Dawn (z â¼ 30). During these epochs, early stars and black holes heated and ionized the IGM, introducing ï¬uctuations in 21 cm emission. HERA is designed to characterize the evolution of the 21 cm power spectrum to constrain the timing and morphology of reionization, the properties of the ï¬rst galaxies, the evolution of large-scale structure, and the early sources of heating. The full HERA instrument will be a 350-element interferometer in South Africa consisting of 14-m parabolic dishes observing from 50 to 250 MHz. Currently, 19 dishes have been deployed on site and the next 18 are under construction. HERA has been designated as an SKA Precursor instrument. In this paper, we summarize HERAâs scientiï¬c context and provide forecasts for its key science results. After reviewing the current state of the art in foreground mitigation, we use the delay-spectrum technique to motivate high-level performance requirements for the HERA instrument. Next, we present the HERA instrument design, along with the subsystem speciï¬cations that ensure that HERA meets its performance requirements. Finally, we summarize the schedule and status of the project. We conclude by suggesting that, given the realities of foreground contamination, currentgeneration 21 cm instruments are approaching their sensitivity limits. HERA is designed to bring both the sensitivity and the precision to deliver its primary science on the basis of proven foreground ï¬ltering techniques, while developing new subtraction techniques to unlock new capabilities. The result will be a major step toward realizing the widely recognized scientiï¬c potential of 21 cm cosmology.},

	abstract = {A new method for estimating the angular power spectrum Cl from cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps is presented, which has the following desirable properties. (1) It is unbeatable in the sense that no other method can measure Cl with smaller error bars. (2) It is quadratic, which makes the statistical properties of the measurements easy to compute and use for estimation of cosmological parameters. (3) It is computationally faster than rival high-precision methods such as the nonlinear maximum-likelihood technique, with the crucial steps scaling as n2 rather than n3, where n is the number of map pixels. (4) It is applicable to any survey geometry whatsoever, with arbitrary regions masked out and arbitrary noise behavior. (5) It is not a âblack-boxâ method, but quite simple to understand intuitively: it corresponds to a high-pass filtering and edge softening of the original map followed by a straight expansion in truncated spherical harmonics. It is argued that this method is computationally feasible even for future high-resolution CMB experiments with nâ¼106â107. It is shown that Cl computed with this method is useful not merely for graphical presentation purposes, but also as an intermediate (and arguably necessary) step in the data analysis pipeline, reducing the data set to a more manageable size before the final step of constraining Gaussian cosmological models and parameters â while retaining all the cosmological information that was present in the original map.},

	abstract = {The next generation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments can measure cosmological parameters with unprecedented accuracyâin principle. To achieve this in practice when faced with such gigantic data sets, elaborate data analysis methods are needed to make it computationally feasible. An important step in the data pipeline is to make a map, which typically reduces the size of the data set by orders of magnitude. We compare 10 map-making methods and find that for the Gaussian case, both the method used by the COBE Differential Microwave Radiometer (DMR) team and various forms of Wiener filtering are optimal in the sense that the map retains all cosmological information that was present in the time-ordered data (TOD). Specifically, one obtains just as small error bars on cosmological parameters when estimating them from the map as one could have obtained by estimating them directly from the TOD. The method of simply averaging the observations of each pixel (for total-power detectors), on the contrary, is found generally to destroy information, as does the maximum entropy method and most other nonlinear map-making techniques. Since it is also numerically feasible, the COBE method is the natural choice for large data sets. Other lossless (e.g., Wiener-filtered) maps can then be computed directly from the COBE method map.},

A new generation of radio telescopes is being constructed for this purpose with the first results starting to trickle in. In this review, we detail the physics that governs the 21 cm signal and describe what might be learnt from upcoming observations.

	abstract = {We present the E-field Parallel Imaging Calibration (EPICal) algorithm, which addresses the need for a fast calibration method for direct imaging radio astronomy correlators. Direct imaging involves a spatial fast Fourier transform of antenna signals, alleviating an \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(N\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ant\}\}{\textasciicircum}2)\$ computational bottleneck typical in radio correlators, and yielding a more gentle \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(N\_g {\textbackslash}log\_2 N\_g)\$ scaling, where \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ant\}\}\$ is the number of antennas in the array and \$N\_g\$ is the number of grid points in the imaging analysis. This can save orders of magnitude in computation cost for next generation arrays consisting of hundreds or thousands of antennas. However, because antenna signals are mixed in the imaging correlator without creating visibilities, gain correction must be applied prior to imaging, rather than on visibilities post-correlation. We develop the EPICal algorithm to form gain solutions quickly and without ever forming visibilities. This method scales as the number of antennas, and produces results comparable to those from visibilities. We use simulations to demonstrate the EPICal technique and study the noise properties of our gain solutions, showing they are similar to visibility based solutions in realistic situations. By applying EPICal to two seconds of Long Wavelength Array data we achieve a 65\% dynamic range improvement compared to uncalibrated images, showing this algorithm is a promising solution for next generation instruments.},

	abstract = {We present a filtering technique that can be applied to individual baselines of wide-bandwidth, wide-field interferometric data to geometrically select regions on the celestial sphere that contain primary calibration sources. The technique relies on the Fourier transformation of wide-band frequency spectra from a given baseline to obtain one-dimensional "delay images", and then the transformation of a time-series of delay images to obtain two-dimensional "delay/delay-rate images." Source selection is possible in these images given appropriate combinations of baseline, bandwidth, integration time and source location. Strong and persistent radio frequency interference (RFI) limits the effectiveness of this source selection owing to the removal of data by RFI excision algorithms. A one-dimensional, complex CLEAN algorithm has been developed to compensate for RFI-excision effects. This approach allows CLEANed, source-isolated data to be used to isolate bandpass and primary beam gain functions. These techniques are applied to data from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) as a demonstration of their value in calibrating a new generation of low-frequency radio interferometers with wide relative bandwidths and large fields-of-view.},

	abstract = {Radio astronomy observatories with high throughput back end instruments require real-time data processing. While computing hardware continues to advance rapidly, development of real-time processing pipelines remains difficult and time-consuming, which can limit scientific productivity. Motivated by this, we have developed Bifrost: an open-source software framework for rapid pipeline development. Bifrost combines a high-level Python interface with highly efficient reconfigurable data transport and a library of computing blocks for CPU and GPU processing. The framework is generalizable, but initially it emphasizes the needs of high-throughput radio astronomy pipelines, such as the ability to process data buffers as if they were continuous streams, the capacity to partition processing into distinct data sequences (e.g., separate observations), and the ability to extract specific intervals from buffered data. Computing blocks in the library are designed for applications such as interferometry, pulsar dedispersion and timing, and transient search pipelines. We describe the design and implementation of the Bifrost framework and demonstrate its use as the backbone in the correlation and beamforming back end of the Long Wavelength Array station in the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, NM.},

Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) in South Africa. This work extends the work presented in Parsons et al. (2014) with more collecting area, a longer observing period, improved redundancy-based calibration, optimal fringe-rate filtering, and improved power-spectral analysis using optimal quadratic estimators. The result is a new \$2{\textbackslash}sigma\$ upper limit on \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}\{2\}(k)\$ of (22.4 mK)\${\textasciicircum}2\$ in the range \$0.15 {\textless} k {\textless} 0.5h{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at \$z = 8.4\$. This represents a three-fold improvement over the previous best upper limit. As we discuss in more depth in a forthcoming paper (Pober et al. 2015, in prep), this upper limit supports and extends previous evidence against extremely cold reionization scenarios. We conclude with a discussion of implications for future 21cm reionization experiments, including the newly funded Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). \${\textbackslash}textbf\{The limits presented in this paper have been retracted: The erratum can be found in Appendix A.\}\$},

	abstract = {We present new constraints on the 21cm Epoch of Reionization (EoR) power spectrum derived from 3 months of observing with a 32-antenna, dual-polarization deployment of the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) in South Africa. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of the delay-spectrum approach to avoiding foregrounds, achieving over 8 orders of magnitude of foreground suppression (in \${\textbackslash}textrm\{mK\}{\textasciicircum}2\$). Combining this approach with a procedure for removing off-diagonal covariances arising from instrumental systematics, we achieve a best 2-sigma upper limit of \$(41{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}textrm\{mK\}){\textasciicircum}2\$ for \$k=0.27 h{\textbackslash}textrm\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at \$z=7.7\$. This limit falls within an order of magnitude of the brighter predictions of the expected 21cm EoR signal level. Using the upper limits set by these measurements, we generate new constraints on the brightness temperature of 21cm emission in neutral regions for various reionization models. We show that for several ionization scenarios, our measurements are inconsistent with cold reionization. That is, heating of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) is necessary to remain consistent with the constraints we report. Hence, we have suggestive evidence that by \$z=7.7\$, the HI has been warmed from its cold primordial state, probably by X-rays from high-mass X-ray binaries or mini-quasars. The strength of this evidence depends on the ionization state of the IGM, which we are not yet able to constrain. This result is consistent with standard predictions for how reionization might have proceeded.},

	abstract = {Radio astronomy observatories with high throughput back end instruments require real-time data processing. While computing hardware continues to advance rapidly, development of real-time processing pipelines remains difficult and time-consuming, which can limit scientific productivity. Motivated by this, we have developed Bifrost: an open-source software framework for rapid pipeline development. Bifrost combines a high-level Python interface with highly efficient reconfigurable data transport and a library of computing blocks for CPU and GPU processing. The framework is generalizable, but initially it emphasizes the needs of high-throughput radio astronomy pipelines, such as the ability to process data buffers as if they were continuous streams, the capacity to partition processing into distinct data sequences (e.g., separate observations), and the ability to extract specific intervals from buffered data. Computing blocks in the library are designed for applications such as interferometry, pulsar dedispersion and timing, and transient search pipelines. We describe the design and implementation of the Bifrost framework and demonstrate its use as the backbone in the correlation and beamforming back end of the Long Wavelength Array station in the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, NM.},

We employ commissioning data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array to investigate closure quantities in this densely packed grid array of 14m antennas operating at 100 MHz to 200 MHz. We investigate techniques that utilize closure phase spectra for redundant triads to estimate departures from redundancy for redundant baseline visibilities. We find a median absolute deviation from redundancy in closure phase across the observed frequency range of about 4.5deg. This value translates into a non-redundancy per visibility phase of about 2.6deg, using prototype electronics. The median absolute deviations from redundancy decrease with longer baselines. We show that closure phase spectra can be used to identify ill-behaved antennas in the array, independent of calibration. We investigate the temporal behavior of closure spectra. The Allan variance increases after a one minute stride time, due to passage of the sky through the primary beam of the transit telescope. However, the closure spectra repeat to well within the noise per measurement at corresponding local sidereal times (LST) from day to day. In future papers in this series we will develop the technique of using closure phase spectra in the search for the HI 21cm signal from cosmic reionization.},

	abstract = {A new gauge theory of gravity is presented. The theory is constructed in a flat background spacetime and employs gauge fields to ensure that all relations between physical quantities are independent of the positions and orientations of the matter fields. In this manner all properties of the background spacetime are removed from physics, and what remains are a set of `intrinsic' relations between physical fields. The properties of the gravitational gauge fields are derived from both classical and quantum viewpoints. Field equations are then derived from an action principle, and consistency with the minimal coupling procedure selects an action that is unique up to the possible inclusion of a cosmological constant. This in turn singles out a unique form of spin-torsion interaction. A new method for solving the field equations is outlined and applied to the case of a time-dependent, spherically-symmetric perfect fluid. A gauge is found which reduces the physics to a set of essentially Newtonian equations. These equations are then applied to the study of cosmology, and to the formation and properties of black holes. The existence of global solutions enables one to discuss the properties of field lines inside the horizon due to a point charge held outside it. The Dirac equation is studied in a black hole background and provides a quick derivation of the Hawking temperature.},

	abstract = {The current generation of experiments aiming to detect the neutral hydrogen signal from the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) is likely to be limited by systematic effects associated with removing foreground sources from target fields. In this paper we develop a model for the compact foreground sources in one of the target fields of the MWA's EoR key science experiment: the `EoR1' field. The model is based on both the MWA's GLEAM survey and GMRT 150 MHz data from the TGSS survey, the latter providing higher angular resolution and better astrometric accuracy for compact sources than is available from the MWA alone. The model contains 5049 sources, some of which have complicated morphology in MWA data, Fornax A being the most complex. The higher resolution data show that 13\% of sources that appear point-like to the MWA have complicated morphology such as double and quad structure, with a typical separation of 33{\textasciitilde}arcsec. We derive an analytic expression for the error introduced into the EoR two-dimensional power spectrum due to peeling close double sources as single point sources and show that for the measured source properties, the error in the power spectrum is confined to high \$k\_{\textbackslash}bot\$ modes that do not affect the overall result for the large-scale cosmological signal of interest. The brightest ten mis-modelled sources in the field contribute 90\% of the power bias in the data, suggesting that it is most critical to improve the models of the brightest sources. With this hybrid model we reprocess data from the EoR1 field and show a maximum of 8\% improved calibration accuracy and a factor of two reduction in residual power in \$k\$-space from peeling these sources. Implications for future EoR experiments including the SKA are discussed in relation to the improvements obtained.},

A novel peeling scheme is used to subtract 2500 sources from the visibilities with ionospheric and beam corrections, resulting in the deepest, confusion-limited MWA image so far. The resulting spectra are found to be affected by instrumental effects, which limit the constraints that can be set on source-intrinsic spectral structure. The sensitivity and power-spectrum of the spectra are analysed, and it is found that the spectra of residuals are dominated by PSF sidelobes from nearby undeconvolved sources.

We present a catalogue of 7394 extragalactic sources at 182 MHz detected in the RA=0 field of the Murchison Widefield Array Epoch of Reionization observation programme. Motivated by unprecedented requirements for precision and reliability we develop new methods for source finding and selection. We apply machine learning methods to self-consistently classify the relative reliability of 9490 source candidates. A subset of 7466 are selected based on reliability class and signal-to-noise ratio criteria. These are statistically cross-matched to four other radio surveys using both position and flux density information. We find 7369 sources to have confident matches, including 90 partially resolved sources that split into a total of 192 sub-components. An additional 25 unmatched sources are included as new radio detections. The catalogue sources have a median spectral index of -0.85. Spectral flattening is seen toward lower frequencies with a median of -0.71 predicted at 182 MHz. The astrometric error is 7 arcsec. compared to a 2.3 arcmin. beam FWHM. The resulting catalogue covers approximately 1400 sq. deg. and is complete to approximately 80 mJy within half beam power.

	abstract = {The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has collected hundreds of hours of Epoch of Reionization (EoR) data and now faces the challenge of overcoming foreground and systematic contamination to reduce the data to a cosmological measurement. We introduce several novel analysis techniques such as cable reflection calibration, hyper-resolution gridding kernels, diffuse foreground model subtraction, and quality control methods. Each change to the analysis pipeline is tested against a two dimensional power spectrum figure of merit to demonstrate improvement. We incorporate the new techniques into a deep integration of 32 hours of MWA data. This data set is used to place a systematic-limited upper limit on the cosmological power spectrum of \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}leq 2.7 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ mK\${\textasciicircum}2\$ at \$k=0.27\$ h{\textasciitilde}Mpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and \$z=7.1\$, consistent with other published limits, and a modest improvement (factor of 1.4) over previous MWA results. From this deep analysis we have identified a list of improvements to be made to our EoR data analysis strategies. These improvements will be implemented in the future and detailed in upcoming publications.},

	abstract = {The Long Wavelength Array (LWA) will be a new multi-purpose radio telescope operating in the frequency range 10-88 MHz. Upon completion, LWA will consist of 53 phased array "stations" distributed over a region about 400 km in diameter in the state of New Mexico. Each station will consist of 256 pairs of dipole-type antennas whose signals are formed into beams, with outputs transported to a central location for high-resolution aperture synthesis imaging. The resulting image sensitivity is estimated to be a few mJy (5 sigma, 8 MHz, 2 polarizations, 1 hr, zenith) in 20-80 MHz; with resolution and field of view of (8", 8 deg) and (2",2 deg) at 20 MHz and 80 MHz, respectively. All 256 dipole antennas are in place for the first station of the LWA (called LWA-1), and commissioning activities are well underway. The station is located near the core of the EVLA, and is expected to be fully operational in early 2011.},

	abstract = {The first station of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA1) was completed in April 2011 and is currently performing observations resulting from its first call for proposals in addition to a continuing program of commissioning and characterization observations. The instrument consists of 258 dual-polarization dipoles, which are digitized and combined into beams. Four independently-steerable dual-polarization beams are available, each with two "tunings" of 16 MHz bandwidth that can be independently tuned to any frequency between 10 MHz and 88 MHz. The system equivalent flux density for zenith pointing is {\textasciitilde}3 kJy and is approximately independent of frequency; this corresponds to a sensitivity of {\textasciitilde}5 Jy/beam (5sigma, 1 s); making it one of the most sensitive meter-wavelength radio telescopes. LWA1 also has two "transient buffer" modes which allow coherent recording from all dipoles simultaneously, providing instantaneous all-sky field of view. LWA1 provides versatile and unique new capabilities for Galactic science, pulsar science, solar and planetary science, space weather, cosmology, and searches for astrophysical transients. Results from LWA1 will detect or tightly constrain the presence of hot Jupiters within 50 parsecs of Earth. LWA1 will provide excellent resolution in frequency and in time to examine phenomena such as solar bursts, and pulsars over a 4:1 frequency range that includes the poorly understood turnover and steep-spectrum regimes. Observations to date have proven LWA1's potential for pulsar observing, and just a few seconds with the completed 256-dipole LWA1 provide the most sensitive images of the sky at 23 MHz obtained yet. We are operating LWA1 as an open skies radio observatory, offering {\textasciitilde}2000 beam-hours per year to the general community.},

	abstract = {After stars formed in the early Universe, their ultraviolet light is expected, eventually, to have penetrated the primordial hydrogen gas and altered the excitation state of its 21-centimetre hyperfine line. This alteration would cause the gas to absorb photons from the cosmic microwave background, producing a spectral distortion that should be observable today at radio frequencies of less than 200 megahertz1. Here we report the detection of a flattened absorption profile in the sky-averaged radio spectrum, which is centred at a frequency of 78 megahertz and has a best-fitting full-width at half-maximum of 19 megahertz and an amplitude of 0.5 kelvin. The profile is largely consistent with expectations for the 21-centimetre signal induced by early stars; however, the best-fitting amplitude of the profile is more than a factor of two greater than the largest predictions2. This discrepancy suggests that either the primordial gas was much colder than expected or the background radiation temperature was hotter than expected. Astrophysical phenomena (such as radiation from stars and stellar remnants) are unlikely to account for this discrepancy; of the proposed extensions to the standard model of cosmology and particle physics, only cooling of the gas as a result of interactions between dark matter and baryons seems to explain the observed amplitude3. The low-frequency edge of the observed profile indicates that stars existed and had produced a background of Lyman-Î± photons by 180 million years after the Big Bang. The high-frequency edge indicates that the gas was heated to above the radiation temperature less than 100 million years later.},

	abstract = {As telescope facilities become increasingly more capable they also become increasingly complex and require additional resources to operate. This is particularly true for the current and future generations of "software defined telescopes" that can support a variety of observing programs simultaneously, either through commensal observations or through support for multiple pointing centers as in the case of dipole arrays or dishes equipped with phased array feeds. At the same time, many current and future facilities are also distributed over large geographic areas, making monitoring and maintenance more difficult and costly. For these reasons we have developed a new paradigm for telescope operations called the "swarm telescope" that breaks large, single facilities into smaller groups of independent systems that can collaboratively work together to function as a single facility but with much less operational overhead. In this paper we outline the swarm telescope concept and an example of its implementation at the Long Wavelength Array. We also discuss potential advantages of using this approach for other facilities, in particular the Next Generation Very Large Array.},
